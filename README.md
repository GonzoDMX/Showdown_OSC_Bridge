# Showdown OSC Bridge
The Showdown OSC Bridge is a utility program for converting standard UDP message strings into OSC protocol (Open Sound Control) messages. It is also capable of routing signals to multple OSC devices simultaneously. This was created to facilitate the integration of OSC based devices into show control systems that lacked OSC functionality. This app is a useful utility for technicians and engineers who work in theatre and live events production.

I created the app when I found myself in a situation where I couldn't interface a lighting console with a central show control system. Originally designed for personal use I've received enough requests for it that I decided to rework the app a little bit and release it.
